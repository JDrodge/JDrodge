# Hi, I'm Jonny 👋
## A Product Analyst from the UK.

- 🚀 I enjoy working with large data sets, solving complex product analytics problems and making datasets and BI reports performant with analytics engineering.
- 🧠 I love projects which combine product chops, i.e speaking to customers, prioritising which problems to work on next, teaching / learning from a great team of people around me, and working on technology which makes a positive impact in the world.
